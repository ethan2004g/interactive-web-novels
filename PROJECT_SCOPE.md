# Interactive Web Novels Platform - Project Scope

**Project Start Date:** January 6, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 6, 2026

---

## 📋 Project Overview

An interactive web novel platform where authors can write and publish books with both traditional text and coded interactive elements. Readers can enjoy stories with branching storylines, animations, custom styling, and visual novel-style features.

### Key Differentiator
Authors can not only write chapters but also **code** them with:
- Branching storylines with reader choices
- Animations and visual effects
- Custom styling and templates
- Embedded images and code snippets
- Visual novel elements (dialogue boxes, character sprites, backgrounds)

### Reader Experience
- Toggle visual effects on/off (preserving story-critical elements)
- Render chapters like normal webpages
- Track reading progress, bookmark, comment, and rate
